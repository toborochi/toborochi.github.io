Hi, I'm Leonardo, I study Informatic Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications at the [Gabriel Rene Moreno Autonomous University](https://www.uagrm.edu.bo/). My main areas of interest are graphic programming, game development and theory of computation. Occasionally I make my lecture notes in $$\LaTeX$$
