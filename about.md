Hi, I'm Leonardo, I study Informatic Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications at the Gabriel Rene Moreno Autonomous University. My main areas of interest are graphic programming, game development and theory of computation. Occasionally I make my lecture notes in $$\LaTeX$$
