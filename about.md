Hi, I am Leonardo, a Informatic Engineering student at the Faculty of Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications, at the [Gabriel Rene Moreno Autonomous University](https://www.uagrm.edu.bo). My main areas of interest are graphic programming, video game development and theory of computation. In my free time I write some things in $$\LaTeX$$.
